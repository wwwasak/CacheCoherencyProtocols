    <h1>Assignment: The Cache Coherency Protocols</h1>
    <p class="cws_code_q">InitInputs</p>
    <p>
        This assignment familiarizes you with four of the cache coherency protocols —MSI, MOSI, MESI,MOESI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider a multiprocessor system with 4 cores (Core A, Core B, Core C,Core D) and a shared memory.
        And the cache lines of all cores are invalid in the initial state (I state). 
        </p>
    <p>
        Now there are 5 operations performed on address 'X' as follows:</p>
        <span class="cws_code_q">GetOperations</span>
        <p> Through the above operations,you need to record the state after each operation and the total number of memory write-back and invalidation operations.</p>
       <p> Please use the abbreviations M, S, I, O, E to represent the status of each cache line.</p><p>Follow the instructions of "Core A status", "Core B status", "Core C status", "Core D status", "the total number of memory write-back ” ,"the total number of invalidation operations "Write your answer in this order.
    </p>
    <h2>Task1</h2>
    <p>
        Through the above operations, based on the MSI protocol
    </p>
<p><span style="color: red;" class="cws_code_a">GetMSIAll</span></p>
    <h2>Task2</h2>
    <p>
        Through the above operations, based on the MESI protocol
    </p>
    <p><span style="color: red;" class="cws_code_a">GetMESIAll</span></p>

    <h2>Task3</h2>
    <p>
        Through the above operations, based on the MOSI protocol
    </p>
    <p><span style="color: red;" class="cws_code_a">GetMOSIAll</span></p>
    <h2>Task4</h2>
    <p>
        Through the above operations, based on the MOESI protocol
    </p>
    <p><span style="color: red;" class="cws_code_a">GetMOESIAll</span></p>

            The expected learning outcomes of this assignment are as follows.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Understand the operation of the four protocols by record cache state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Understand the pros and cons of different protocols by recording the number of memory write-back, invalidation operations
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
